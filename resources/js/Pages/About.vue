    <h1>The BMW Group company profile.</h1>

    <p>
      The special fascination of the BMW Group not only lies in its products and technology,

       is the world’s leading manufacturer of premium automobiles and motorcycles,

    <h1>Production today and tomorrow.</h1>
      <p>
        The BMW Group sets trends in production technology and sustainability as an innovation
        leader with an intelligent material mix, a technological shift towards digitalisation and
